# SudokuSolver

Sudoku Solver (JAVA)
To use: Create a text file, start with inserting the dimension of the board, for example, 9 or 4. 
Afterwards, you can create your own board, using '.' as blank space, and numbers to fill the space.
Make sure to name your file "sudoku-board-1.txt." 
It is important to name this format because run() function takes a number, and calls the file by
appending "sudoku-board-" with the given num, for example run(5) will append "sudoku-board-" + 5 + ".txt 
If the given board is not solvable, the program will return false.
